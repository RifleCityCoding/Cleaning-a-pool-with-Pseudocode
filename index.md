# How to clean a pool explained with pseudocode!
<br>

### This is a step by step guide for maintaining a pool with a sand filter.

### Lets start with a list for the steps to cleaning the pool.

[x] Check and empty the skimmer

[x] Skimming the pool

[x] Vacuuming the pool

[x] Checking the chlorine levels

<br>
<br>

## Step 1

### Emptying the skimmer should be your first step to a clean pool. This and your filter are the organs of your pool Keep them healthy!

    IF (Filter is on) {
    Turn it off;
    ELSE {
    Continue to skimmer;
    }
    }

    IF (skimmer has debree) {
        Pull out and empty and clean off;
    
    Else {
        Skip this step;
    }}

## Step 2

### Time to skim the surface!

    IF (skimming net is not on pole) {
        Attach net to pole;
    ELSE {
        skip this step;
        }}

        WHILE (Debree is on pool surface){
            Use skimming net to pull debree out of pool and discard;
            ELSE{
                Move on to the next step;
            }
        }

## Step 3

### Lets vacuum up that dirty floor!

    IF (vacuum head is not on pole) {
        Attach vacuum head to pole;
        ELSE {
            Continue;
        }
    }

    IF (Vacuum and skimmer not attached to either end of tube) {
        Attach skimmer to one end of tube, fill with water, and other end to top of vacuum;
            Else {
                Continue with step;
            }
        }
    

    IF (your pool filter is still off){
        Continue;
        ELSE {
            Turn filter off
        }
    }

    IF (pool filter is off and light debree in the bottom) {
        Turn the filter on;
        ELSE IF (filter is off and heavy debree ) {
            Change filter to WASTE and turn on;
        }
    }

    WHILE (Pool floor is dirty) {
        SLOWLY move your vacuum back and forth to remove debree;

        ELSE {
            Turn off filter and remove vacuum from pool and skimmer;
        }
    }

## Step 4

### The balancing act we call CHEMICALS! In this example we are using the [Taylor Test Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Taylor-9056-Chlorine-Comparator-Replacement/dp/B004VU87JG/ref=asc_df_B004VU87JG/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=198092864586&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18221227625024329075&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9014315&hvtargid=pla-348631668470&psc=1>) to adjust our chlorine

    IF (Test kit is out of box and ready) {
        Continue;
        ELSE {
            Get your test kit out!;
        }
    }

    WHILE (test tube is empty) {
        Fill tube up with pool water from at least elbow deep;
        ELSE {
           Add 5 drops R-0001 and 5 drops R-0002 cover and shake tube;
        }
    }

    IF (the coloration is too light){
        Add more chlorine to the pool;

        ELSE IF (The coloration is too dark) {
            Pause swimming for the day and let the sun evaporate the chlorine;

            ELSE {
                Throw those trunks on and get swimming!
            }
        }
    }
